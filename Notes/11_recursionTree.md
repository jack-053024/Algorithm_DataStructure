# How to analyze the time complexity of recursive code

> There are two ways to analyze the time complexity of recursive code, one is through a recursive formula, and the other is a recursive tree. In many cases, the analysis of recursive code through recursive formulas can be complicated, and recursive trees are a better choice at this time. In fact, recursive trees are our most commonly used.
